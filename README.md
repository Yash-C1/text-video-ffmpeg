# text-video-converter
This is an application that takes text / pdf transcript as an input and generates an audio of the text. It then takes a video input and merges the audio and video to generate a final video.

Note-
1. This application accepts input transcript in pdf format only.
2. You can either enter text manually or upload the transcript in pdf format.
3. In the next page, uploading an audio is optional. If you don't upload any audio, the autogenerated audio in step 1 would be used to merge with the video.
4. If you want to run the application multiple times, there is no need to delete earlier generated and uploaded files manually. The remove_files function deletes all earlier files.

How to run the application?  
---
1. Open the terminal and run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
2. Run the command 'python manage.py runserver' in the terminal.
